# Automated Release Process Documentation

This document outlines the **automated** release process for the Scaffold Scripts project. The manual process has been replaced with a streamlined, automated workflow using GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Overview

The automated workflow uses a **develop → release → main** branching strategy with complete CI/CD automation:

```
develop branch (work here)
    ↓ (automatic)
  PR to release (validation + review)
    ↓ (manual merge)
  release branch (triggers publish)
    ↓ (automatic)
  main branch (synced after publish)
    ↓ (automatic) 
  NPM + GitHub Release
```

### Complete Automation Flow:

1. **Push to develop** → Triggers validation and PR creation
2. **Auto-validation** → Runs precommit, tests, security audit
3. **Smart PR management** → Creates/updates single PR with status
4. **Manual merge** → Developer reviews and merges when ready
5. **Auto-publish** → NPM publish, version bump, GitHub release
6. **Branch sync** → release branch synced to main automatically

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Step 1: Work on Develop Branch

All development work should be done on the `develop` branch:

```bash
# Switch to develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Make your changes
# ... code changes ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature or fix"
git push origin develop
```

### Step 2: Automated Validation

**GitHub Actions will automatically:**
- ✅ Auto-merge from `release` branch (if needed)
- ✅ Run `npm run precommit` (build + test + lint + typecheck)
- ✅ Validate all tests pass
- ✅ Check security audit
- ✅ Verify package integrity

### Step 3: Auto-Generated Release PR

The workflow will **automatically create or update** a PR with:
- **Validation status** (all checks completed)
- **Commit summary** (categorized by features, fixes, improvements)
- **Review checklist** for manual approval
- **Smart commit grouping** (last 5 commits + total count)

Example PR title: `🚀 Release Candidate: 2025-07-09 - 4 commits`

### Step 4: Manual Review & Merge

Review the auto-generated PR and merge when ready:

```bash
# View the PR
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER>

# Merge when ready
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --merge
```

### Step 5: Automatic Deployment

**CI will automatically:**
- 🔄 Run all tests again
- 📦 Build the project
- 🏷️ Bump version number
- 🏷️ Create Git tag
- 📢 Publish to NPM
- 🚀 Create GitHub release with dynamic release notes

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### ✅ **No Manual Precommit Required**
- GitHub Actions runs `npm run precommit` automatically
- No need to remember to run validation locally
- Consistent validation across all commits

### ✅ **Automated Release Branch Syncing**
- Auto-merges from `release` branch to avoid conflicts
- Handles merge conflicts gracefully
- Keeps develop branch up-to-date

### ✅ **Smart PR Management**
- One PR per develop branch (updates with each commit)
- Categorized change summaries
- Manageable commit lists (last 5 + total count)

### ✅ **Zero Manual Version Management**
- CI auto-increments version numbers
- Automatic Git tagging
- Dynamic release notes generation

## 🔧 Detailed Workflow Mechanics

### 🤖 What Happens When You Push to Develop

**Trigger:** `git push origin develop`

**Automatic Actions:**
1. **Branch Sync Check** - Compares develop with release branch
2. **Auto-merge** - Merges release → develop if behind (prevents conflicts)
3. **Dependency Install** - Fresh `npm ci` in clean environment
4. **Full Validation** - Runs complete `npm run precommit`:
   - TypeScript compilation (`npm run build`)
   - Unit tests (`npm run test:unit`)
   - ESLint validation (`npm run lint`)
   - Type checking (`npm run typecheck`)
5. **Security Audit** - Checks for vulnerable dependencies
6. **PR Management** - Creates or updates existing develop→release PR

### 📋 Smart PR Creation

**Single PR Strategy:** Only one PR exists from develop→release at any time

**PR Content Includes:**
- ✅ **Validation checklist** (automatically checked when passing)
- 📊 **Commit categorization** (features, fixes, improvements)
- 📝 **Recent commits summary** (last 5 + total count)
- ⚠️ **Merge conflict warnings** (if auto-merge failed)
- 🔄 **Updated timestamps** (shows latest validation run)

**Example PR Title:** `🚀 Release Candidate: 2025-07-09 - 4 commits`

### 🚀 What Happens When You Merge to Release

**Trigger:** Merge the auto-generated PR

**Automatic Actions:**
1. **Re-validation** - Runs tests again on release branch
2. **Version Bump** - Auto-increments patch version (e.g., 1.1.17 → 1.1.18)
3. **Git Tagging** - Creates `v1.1.18` tag automatically
4. **NPM Publish** - Publishes to registry with provenance
5. **Branch Sync** - Fast-forward merges release → main
6. **GitHub Release** - Auto-generates with dynamic release notes
7. **Duplicate Prevention** - Skips if version already published

### 🔧 Workflow Files

The automation is powered by these GitHub Actions:

#### `.github/workflows/validation.yml`
**Triggers:** PRs to develop/release/main, pushes to develop
**Purpose:** Continuous validation
- Executes full precommit validation suite
- Security audit and package integrity checks
- Validates release documentation exists

#### `.github/workflows/develop-to-release.yml` 
**Triggers:** Push to develop branch
**Purpose:** Automated PR management
- Auto-merges from release branch (conflict prevention)
- Runs comprehensive validation pipeline  
- Creates/updates single release candidate PR
- Smart commit categorization and summary

#### `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
**Triggers:** Push to release branch, manual workflow dispatch
**Purpose:** Publication and distribution
- Version management and Git tagging
- NPM publishing with provenance signatures
- GitHub release creation with dynamic notes
- Main branch synchronization

## 📋 Manual Tasks (Minimal)

You only need to manually:
1. **Write code** and commit to `develop`
2. **Review PR** created by automation
3. **Merge PR** when ready for release
4. **Test published package** (optional)

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Recovery

### 🔧 Intelligent Conflict Resolution
**Auto-merge Failures:** When develop diverges from release
- Workflow detects conflicts automatically
- PR description shows "⚠️ Merge conflicts detected" 
- **Manual fix:** `git checkout develop && git merge origin/release`
- Push resolved merge - workflow automatically re-validates

### 🚨 Validation Failures
**Build/Test/Lint Errors:** When code doesn't pass validation
- PR shows "❌ Validation failed" with error details
- GitHub Actions logs provide specific failure reasons
- **Fix locally:** Address issues and `git push origin develop`
- Workflow automatically re-runs validation on new push

### 📦 Publication Failures  
**NPM/Release Issues:** Version conflicts or auth problems
- **Version exists:** CI automatically skips duplicate versions
- **Auth failures:** Check `NPM_TOKEN` secret configuration
- **Network issues:** Workflow includes retry logic and timeouts
- **Manual intervention:** Use `workflow_dispatch` trigger for specific versions

### 🔄 Recovery Scenarios

**Stuck PR:** If develop→release PR becomes stale
```bash
# Close the PR and trigger fresh creation
gh pr close <PR_NUMBER>
git push origin develop --force-with-lease
```

**Failed Release:** If publish partially completes
```bash
# Check what succeeded/failed
gh run view <RUN_ID>
# Manually trigger with specific version if needed
gh workflow run publish.yml -f version=patch
```

**Branch Sync Issues:** If main gets out of sync
```bash
# Manually sync main with release
git checkout main && git merge origin/release --ff-only && git push origin main
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Tests failing | ❌ in validation status | Run `npm run test:unit` locally, fix failing tests |
| TypeScript errors | ❌ Type checking failed | Run `npm run typecheck`, fix type issues |
| Lint violations | ❌ Linting failed | Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix, manual fix others |
| Build failures | ❌ Build unsuccessful | Check `npm run build` output, fix compilation errors |
| Version conflicts | Skipping publish | Normal behavior - version already exists on NPM |
| PR not updating | Old validation status | Push new commit to develop to trigger re-validation |

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Release Status
```bash
# View recent releases
gh release list --limit 5

# Check CI runs
gh run list --limit 5

# View latest PR
gh pr list --head develop
```
