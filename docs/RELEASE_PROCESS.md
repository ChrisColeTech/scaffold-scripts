cd app && npm install && cd ..

# Run streamlined pre-commit validation

```

**The `precommit` command runs: build, unit tests, linting, and type checking - all must pass before proceeding.**

### 2. Version Update

```bash
# Update root package.json version

## Hotfix Process

For critical bug fixes that need immediate release:

1. Create hotfix branch from `release`: `git checkout -b hotfix-v1.x.y release`
2. Make minimal necessary changes
3. Follow steps 1-2 from regular release process
4. Create PR from hotfix branch to both `main` and `release`
5. Merge to both branches
6. Follow steps 7-9 from regular release process

## Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (1.x.x): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (x.1.x): New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** (x.x.1): Bug fixes, backwards compatible

## Rollback Process

If a release has critical issues:

1. Immediately revert the merge commit on `release` branch
2. Create hotfix following the hotfix process above
3. Communicate the issue and timeline to users

## Branch Protection

- `main` branch: Requires PR reviews, CI checks must pass
- `release` branch: Requires PR reviews, CI checks must pass
- No direct pushes to protected branches

## CI/CD Configuration

Ensure these GitHub Actions workflows are configured:

- **Continuous Integration**: Runs on all PRs and pushes
- **Publish to NPM**: Runs on pushes to `release` branch
- **Security Scanning**: Runs on schedule and PRs
